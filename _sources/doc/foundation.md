# Foundation

Before we can deep dive into tensor networks, we have to prepare 
ourselves with the tools needed to understand them. Our tool set 
will mostly contain mathematical notions and basic results. Why is
Mathematics so powerful and used in many other fields as 
Computer Science or Physics? One of the reasons is its built-in 
core concept of _abstraction_. It allows to start with very simple 
terms and combine them step by step into more complicated ones.

We will apply the same strategy. We start out with some thoughts about
abstractions and then introduce basic structures of Linear Algebra as 
_vector spaces_ and _linear maps_. Later we will generalize what we have 
learned here to define _tensors_ and _tensor networks_.

## Vector Spaces

## Linear Maps
