# Welcome

Welcome to the wonderful world of _tensor networks_. Tensor ... what?
Since Google has launched [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
tensors are on everyone's lips. Ok, everyone refers to mostly 
computer scientists. But with increased importance of Machine Learning, 
tensors are becoming popular as well.

As we know, some stuff the cool kids are using, are actually rediscoveries 
of old almost forgotten ideas. Tensors are an old concept - and not even forgotten,
but bullet-proof tool in physical theories. The word _tensor_ was introduced in 1846 
by [William Rowan Hamilton](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton),
although it had a different meaning back then. The word refers to 
the [stress principle from continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor). 
Applying force to a rigid body will cause stress which justifies the term 
_tense_. This has been the starting point of success story and tensors have become indispensable in
Physics. One theory heavily relying on, so called _tensor product spaces_, is Quantum Mechanics.
So, everyone who wants to understand _Quantum Computing_ has to deal with tensors.

But what are _tensor networks_? These are ensembles of tensors, interacting with eachother.
This explanation appears simple on first sight, but tensor networks can easily become
a rather complex research topic. But we will untangle them - literally, but more on 
_entanglement_ later. Having in mind, that tensor networks offer interesting applications
in machine learning and quantum computing, check out this course. Have fun 
with a cool and sometimes mind-boggling framework!
