# ToDo

- Add a caption to every picture
- Move parts on __Inner products__ from chapter __Tensors__ to beginning of __Quantum__ chapter
- In section {ref}`sec-tensor-networks-permutations` the matrix indices are still legacy (always
subscript). Adapt this to tensor notation. Furthermore, determinant should be defined row-wise and
not columnwise. (Elementary operations are usually row-operations and not column operations)
