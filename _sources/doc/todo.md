# ToDo

- Add a caption to every picture
- Move parts on __Inner products__ from chapter __Tensors__ to beginning of __Quantum__ chapter
- In section {ref}`sec-tensor-networks-permutations` the matrix indices are still legacy (always
subscript). Adapt this to tensor notation. Furthermore, determinant should be defined row-wise and
not columnwise. (Elementary operations are usually row-operations and not column operations)
- Update references
  - 15-puzzle repository (should also be cloned and iframe-access the clone)
  - map-coloring repository
  - intro to logical programming in python repository
- Adapt {numref}`sec-combinatorics-colorings` (e.g. redraw figures in Biamonte style)
- Add more graphical equations (of Biamonte) to {numref}`sec-combinatorics-boolean-tensors`
- Find (and apply) ad hoc notation for contractions
- Distinguish between $\xor$ and co-$\xor$. This should help in equations that contain both tensors.
- Idea, for contractions with no index notions use e.g. $C_{1,3}(\cdot)$ to contract first and third factor (from left.)
