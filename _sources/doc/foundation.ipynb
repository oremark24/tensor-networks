    "Still, there are reasons within the language's design, enabling this wide acceptance.\n",

    "and expressive power to handle complex tasks and to have short development cycles.\n",
    "Very often these demands stand for incompatible requirements, but Python got both \n",
    "right at the same time. With bindings for C/C++ code and even Fortran routines, it is \n",
    "able to consume high performant numerical code as incorporated in [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) \n",
    "for example. On the other hand, Python is long known for expressive syntax and \n",
    "concepts, for instance _list comprehensions_.\n",

    "Combining both is a nice example of _abstraction_. The details of mathematical\n",
    "algorithms are encapsulated in C/C++ assemblies and abstracted away from the \n",
    "user of libraries as NumPy or pandas. It feels very comfortable to use lightweight\n",
